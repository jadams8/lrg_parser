# Project Document : LRG Parser v1.0

# Brief
Create a tool that parses exon coordinates from LRG files in XML format. The output should be a BED file with genomic coordinates corresponding to each LRG exon region.

# User story
As a scientist, I want to find all the exon start and end co-ordinates in an LRG file correspinding to a gene so that I can identify whether my variant is coding or non-coding.

# Functional requirements
- Take LRG file in XML format as input
- Extract exon regions from LRG records
- Convert LRG exon regions to genomic coordinates
- Create BED-formatted file containing LRG exon regions as genomic coordinates

# Technical requirements
- TR1 The application is compatible with all operating systems in genetics department os use
- TR2 The application will be available 99% of the time
- TR3 The application will be able to take multiple inputs at a time
- TR3 When the input is an existing file, the output will be produced in less than 3 seconds 95% of the time
- TR4 When the input is an existing file, the output will be produced in less than 10 seconds 99% of the time
- TR5 If the LRG input needs to be fetched from the internet the only acceptable reason for failure will be lack of internet connection or LRG website failure
- TR6 If the LRG input needs to be fetched from the internet, the output will be produced in less than 10 seconds 95% of the time
- TR7 If the LRG input needs to be fetched from the internet, the output will be produced in less than 30 seconds 99% of the time

# Project completion checklist:
- Comments and usage documentation
- Unit tests
- Executes without failure (Does the program run?)
