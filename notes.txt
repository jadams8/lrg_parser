# Project Document : LRG Parser v1.0

# Brief
Create a tool that parses exon coordinates from LRG files in XML format. The output should be a BED file with genomic coordinates corresponding to each LRG exon region.

# User story
https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories

# Functional requirements
- Take LRG file in XML format as input
- Extract exon regions from LRG records
- Convert LRG exon regions to genomic coordinates
- Create BED-formatted file containing LRG exon regions as genomic coordinates

# Technical requirements

# Project completion checklist:
- Comments and usage documentation
- Unit tests
- Executes without failure (Does the program run?)
